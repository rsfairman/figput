/*
Code for page layout. The idea is a bit like Java Swing (or a zillion other
similar setups), but stripped down to only what I need. In particular, the
Panels are assumed to be stacked vertically.

Everything is accessed through FullPanel, which consists of a list of
PagePanel objects. These are stacked vertically, and each one contains at 
least one PDFPanel, and may contain FigurePanels. In the lingo of something 
like Java, it would be better to think of PagePanel as a Container or a Box 
since it's used for layout and doesn't directly do anything other than pass 
things to its sub-parts.
