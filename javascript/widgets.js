Widget management code.

Typically, widget management is done with a tightly siloed hierarchy, with
widgets in containers, which are in containers, etc. There is a hierarchy
like that here (though rather flat since I don't need much), but there's also
a global registry of widgets alongside the hierarchy. This makes widgets
easier to work with for the author of the latex document.

I've also avoided any kind of clever abstraction around the widget concept.
This can mean that there's a certain amount of boilerplate (not DRY), but
it also means that things aren't tangled up. Widgets can be individually
modified without worries about side-effects.

All widgets use a register() method rather than a constructor. This
is because the user should be able to specify a widget repeatedly
without actually creating a new one every time it's specified.

So, the user should say something like
let w = RandomWidgetType.register(arguments);
to create a widget from the drawing code. If register() has never been
called for the particular widget, then a new widget *is* created and
a reference to it is placed in global storage. If this widget was created
earlier, then the reference to it is taken from global storage and returned.
So, register() is something like an object factory, but it won't make the
same object more than once.

Every widget is distinguished by its type and the (name of the) figure it
belongs to. In addition, if a figure has several widgets of the same type,
then the user must provide an optional name for that particular widget. For
example, if there are three ButtonWidgets for a given figure, then they
might be created by
let b1 = ButtonWidget.register(whatever,"first");
let b2 = ButtonWidget.register(whatever,"second");
let b3 = ButtonWidget.register(whatever,"third");

-------------------------

One of the ticklish issues is how to associate widgets with their
figures. In most languages, this problem is solved by explicitly using
"this" somehow. In Java, you might say something like
new Widget(this);
to indicate that the owner of the widget is the class from which the widget
was constructed. I would rather not do that because it's the kind of
boilerplate arcana that the user shouldn't have to think about.

JS provides a couple of ways to determine who made a call to a particular
function. The easiest way is like this

function example() {
  let caller = example.caller.name;
  console.log(caller);
}

This should print the name of the function that invoked example().

Another way is very easy to do, but it's been deprecated. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller
Even though it is deprecated, every browser supports it, according to the
above link. Also, my guess is that this is very commonly used since
it's so handy. They won't be getting rid of it any time soon.

If they do get rid of caller.name, then another way to obtain this
information is by creating a bogus Error and examining the call stack:

function example() {
  
  let stack = new Error().stack;
  let caller = stack.split('\n')[1].trim();
  
  // caller is now inforamtion about the function calling this one,
  // including the file name and a bunch of other stuff I don't care about.
  // I just want to know the name of the function.
  // It *appears* (but not extensively tested) that the function name
  // occurs before the first '@'.;
  let callingFcn = caller.split('@')[0];
  console.log(callingFcn);
}

I wanted to use caller.name, even though it is deprecated, because it is
so much easier. Unfortunately, it is not allowed in strict mode.
Since everything that appears within a class is strict, that makes its use
awkward. I tried to get around this by defining a top-level function (outside
any class) that does nothing but return the value I want, but that doesn't
work either. It seems like, as soon as you enter a class, the data you want
is stripped off (or something). Also, now that I've moved to TypeScript any
violation of "strict" is even harder. Since I'll have to define a seperate class
anyway, go ahead and use the Error-based approach.

To top it off, the method via generating an Error is sensitive to the
broswer because different browsers format this information differently.

BUG: Future Widgets...?

Because LoopWidget takes such a crazy number of options, it would be nice
to have several widgets that merely call LoopWidget. This wouldn't really
be any different, but would simplify things for the user. Basically, these
would have a reduced set of arguments to register() and just hand everything
off to LoopWidget. They would be a mere glue skeleton. Same goes for
OpenAnimWidget.

Image Building Widget
  For something like (say) a Mandelbrot set. This takes time to generate
  and you might want to draw it in an open-ended way. It's not reasonable
  to allow the user to move through time and see the state of the image
  at different time steps. The widget should store an off-screen image
  and making the animation "run faster" would mean calling it more frequently
  so that it can do more calculation. So it would use some of the same
  animation infrastructure, but in a different way. The most that makes
  sense here is a pause/run (to reduce computational load) and something
  to increase or decrease the load. This would often be something for which
  it does not make sense to generate tikz. Any JS rendering of a mandelbrot
  set (say) would be terrible for inclusion in a book. You'd generate a
  printed figure like that in some other way, even if an on-line animation
  would be instructive.

Various restrictions on how a DraggableDot can be moved would be handy.
Restricting to a particular line or arc wouldn't be hard, but restricting to
fall on a given Path2D would be hard. The JS implementation of Path2D is
poor, and I would need to reimplement the entire thing from the
ground up. I might need to do some of that anyway for the best tikz output
(I did some stuff along those lines already).

Draggable Line
  Similar to Draggable dot. In fact, it's not clear that this needs its own
  widget. A line is determined by two points, so the user could use a
  draggable dot and just draw the line himself. The only advantage I can
  see to a draggable *line* is that the user could mouse-down on any
  portion of the line. In fact, that could be done with DraggableDot since
  the "dot" could be an entire line.

Scroll bar for number selection.
  Similar to a spinner, but the user drags a dot along a line.
  Not clear whether a numerical value should appear.
  
Checkboxes and Radio buttons
  Gack
  
Drop-down menu
  Stuff like this gets more fiddly. If you have a drop-down menu and
  it has a vertical scroll bar for multiple selections, then it's even worse.
