Main entry point for all the js code behind the browser interface.
 
This has the initialization code, to load the pdf and the data specifying
how figures are drawn and laid out, plus the top-level stuff to direct
events to the proper place for handling.

The same code is used for developing the document, and for serving it
from a public-facing website, with a few changes. Look for "PUBLIC FACING"
annotations. Note also that it would be possible to strip considerably
more code away for the public-facing version, but there's no pressing
reason to do it -- the savings would be tiny -- and it could lead to
an error of some kind due to unforeseen dependencies on the deleted
code.
