Note that 'unknown1' will be changed to the project's name as this file 
is being served. If the pdf generated by LaTeX is called math.pdf, then 
'unknown1' will become 'math'.
BEWARE: This works by replacing every occurence of 'unknown1' in this file,
so don't use 'unknown1' for anything else.
The same basic thing is going on with unknowny, but it is used for scroll
position
