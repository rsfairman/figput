/*
Code necessary to output tikz for figures. It spoofs the normal canvas
drawing code so that the output comes here, and is then converted to
tizk output.

One problem with JS is that there is no path interator. You can't obtain
the segments that make up an entire path. I don't see any way around this
other than writing my own wrapper around Path2D. It might be possible to
somehow hack the internals of Path2D, but that would be brittle, even if
it works.

BUG: The long-term solution is to eliminate use of the JS Path2D class,
but it's not possible to entirely eliminate it since it's the only way to
draw to the browser window. What I *could* do is sub-class
CanvasRenderingContext2D so that this sub-class take my own path class
objects and converts them to Path2D for drawing. Another hurdle is
isPointInPath(), which is used in a few places. I could provide a separate
implementation of that, but it's fiddly. isPointInStroke() is a bit harder.

BUG: It's tempting to come up with a framework under which a "path"
is closer to our intuition of something that can be drawn as a continuous
thing, without lifting your pencil. Then, have a second-order thing that
may hold several of these continuous paths. Intuitively one wants a "path"
to have a clear start-point and end-point, but you also need to be able
to handle things like winding number for multiple paths when filling.

BUG: There are many cases where you might want the online version to be
different from what is printed. I just gave the example of filling a path,
and color is similar. There's lots of things that might make sense on a
computer screen, but wouldn't work well on printed paper.
